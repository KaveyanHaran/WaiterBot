# WaiterBot
I created a program with a robot waiter. It offers interchangeable menus for lunch, dinner, and breakfast. Users choose from various categories and provide inputs. The program calculates total calories, price, and wait time.
It sends the order number to the chef and generates a neat bill. Users can add a tip by percentage or whole dollars.
